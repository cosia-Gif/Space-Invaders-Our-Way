## **Overview**

This project is a recreation of the game Space Invaders. 

---

## **Installation**

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- The Turtle graphics library (included in the Python Standard Library)
- Basic knowledge of running Python scripts

### Steps
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/space-invaders-2.0.git
   cd space-invaders-2.0
   ```
2. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python space-invaders-2.0.py
   ```

---

## **Usage**
Launch the game and use the following controls:
- Arrow keys to move the player spaceship.
- Spacebar to shoot.

Engage with the waves of enemies, collect power-ups, and defeat the boss to progress through the game.

---

## **Features**

### **1. Player Spaceship: Movement and Shooting**
- **Movement:**
  - Horizontal movement is restricted to within screen boundaries to keep the spaceship visible and accessible.
  - Movement functions include boundary checks using conditions like `self.turtle.xcor() > -380` and `self.turtle.xcor() < 380`.
- **Shooting Mechanics:**
  - Players shoot bullets using a cooldown mechanism, preventing excessive firing to maintain game balance.

### **2. Alien Spaceships: Movement and Attacks**
- **Organized Movement:**
  - Aliens move in coordinated patterns with increasing complexity as waves progress.
  - Position updates are handled by adding displacement values `(dx, dy)` to each alien.
- **Projectile Firing:**
  - Aliens shoot randomly with probabilities increasing as the game advances.

### **3. Homing Bullets and Advanced Behavior**
- **Homing Bullets:**
  - Adds strategic complexity by allowing bullets to track the player's position.
  - Key mechanisms include:
    - **Target Angle Calculation:** Trigonometric calculations ensure precise tracking of the player.
    - **Smooth Curving Control:** Limits angle adjustments to maintain dodgability and fluid movement.
    - **Dynamic Activation:** Curving behavior is signaled by changing the bulletâ€™s color to red.

### **4. Boss Mechanics**
- **Health Bar:**
  - Players receive visual feedback on their progress during boss battles through an interactive health bar.

### **5. Collision Detection**
- **Accuracy:**
  - Implements the Euclidean formula to detect collisions between objects like bullets and spaceships.
  - Collision thresholds trigger appropriate game responses.

### **6. Power-Ups**
- **Dynamic Gameplay:**
  - Randomized power-ups offer temporary enhancements, such as increased fire rate or extra lives.
  - Global variables adjust based on the power-up type, with effects reverting after expiration.
